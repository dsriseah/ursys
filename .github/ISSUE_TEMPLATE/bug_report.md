Bug reports should be entered as a Github Issue with the title "BUG: [description]" and include just three elements:

1. **what you expected to see / tried to do**
2. **what you saw instead (w/ screenshots)**
3. **detailed steps to reproduce the bug**

Additionally, you can provide:

4. a **workaround** you found to get around the bug
5. how it **prevents** you from doing something with the software

>[!TIP]
> It is most important to provide (3) **detailed steps** to **reproduce the bug**. Secondarily, the **screen shot** of the bug (**camera phone pictures** is OK too) along with any **error messages** seen.
