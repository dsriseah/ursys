            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                The intent behind URSYS is develop reusable snippets of code that we used to build learning sciences
                research applications in a development environment that I&#39;ve tuned to my liking over time. Because
                it&#39;s a monorepo, I can develop all the features at the same time across different packages.
            </p>

            <p>This example app demonstrates an app based on URSYS. You can copy
                the <tt>example-app</tt> directory and rename it <tt>app</tt> or <tt>app-*</tt> to create a new working
                directory to play with.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <tt>.gitignore</tt> file is set to ignore the <tt>app</tt> directories so you can initialize them as
                your own <span>Git Submodule(s)</span>, each with its own build system and exports through
                <tt>package.json</tt>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Repo Conventions</h2>
            <p>The repo uses the built-in <span>npm workspaces</span> feature with two defined workspaces:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core</strong> is in the <code>_ur</code> directory, and are built as a library.</li>
                <li><strong>Addons</strong> are in <code>_ur_addons</code>, and are services built on top of
                    <strong>Core</strong>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The URSYS repo still in an early stage of development as features from old projects are being modernized for
            Typescript.
