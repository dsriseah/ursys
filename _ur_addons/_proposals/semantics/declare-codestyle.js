/*///////////////////////////////// ABOUT \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\

  Example of Sri's Module Style
  Designed to be more like C# in its lettercasing conventions

  * Pay attention to spacing and capitalization
  * Use the /// commants to designate major sections
  * Obey the spacing conventions in /// comments for typographic weight
  * Follow the order of sections
  * Group similar functions together under the right section

/// GENERAL FUNCTION NAMING ///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
/*/
    Synchronous functions can follow the existing convention but use an
    'immediate' verb in the name like 'get/set' for simple data setting.
    The function should be SIDE EFFECT FREE.
/*/
function m_GetSomething() {}
function m_SetSomething() {}
/*/
    For API methods that operate on common kind of data structure
    or modeled concept, use verbs that use the nomenclature in
    use instead of just using Get/Set and include the concept or object
    that is being operated on. The implication is that you pick
    memorable, unique, and short names in your model design or
    mirror class/object declarations.
/*/
function QueueAction() {} // not SetAction
function ExecuteAction() {} // looks like it's related to QueueAction
/*/
    Asynchronous functions should use a 'waiting' type verb in the name
    (e.g. AwaitSomething, PromiseDoAThing) to imply that the call is asynchronous. \
    Can also use `ma_` prefix for module functions.
/*/
async function m_AwaitSomething() {}
async function ma_ProcessTaskList() {}
function API_PromiseLoadConfig() {}
/*/
    At times you'll be working on a big messy prototype function.
    If you plan on making intermediate "progress" commits to the repo,
    consider naming those big messy functions as WIP_.
/*/
function WIP_DoSomething() {}

/// ASYNC CALLBACKS & EVENTS //////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
/*/
    Handlers that are fired as a callback should be named to imply
    that they are delivering a result. I use cb or cb_ to make
    this distinct from an event handler or functional parameter.
    Note the use of snake_case, similar to inline functions.
    If the callback has to do more work, have it call a higher-
    level function or API method to keep the callback nice and small.
/*/
const cb_timer_expired = () => console.log('expired');
setInterval(cb_timer_expired, 1000);
/*/
    Event handlers come in two flavors: as the immediate handler that
    is registered or subscribed to a source, and the specific
    work that is done. DO NOT COMBINE THEM. In general, your immediate
    handlers should be short and call a higher-level function/method
    that follows our general function naming conventions. This is the
    old wrong way:

      SubmitButton.subscribe('click', HandleClick);
      // handle clicks
      function HandleClick() {
        // save stuff to database
        const DB = GetDB();
        const { data } = GetFormData();
        DB.Write(data);
        // notify subscribers
        SYSTEM.NotifySubscribers(data);
      }

    This is sub-literate code because (1) function names reflect the
    name of a UI event, not what the context of the button does and
    (2) there are side effects that are not hinted by the function
    name (3) these operations are not managed by a single module
    where one would expect to find such operaetions.

    Instead, split the things up using arrow functions that are
    for DISPATCHING the event to an appropriate handler. This allows
    you to centralize action processing. Talk to Sri for more examples
/*/
// this is a dummy declaration of an appcore module, which is
// the only type of module that can talk to both UI and DATA
// modules. It's equivalent to a controller in MVC.
const APPCORE_DATASUBMIT = {
  HandleFormSubmit: function (event, param) {
    const { target } = event;
    // determine what to do based on current state of application
    // do the things
  }
};
// this is a dummy component that is a UI element
const DummySubmitButton = {};
DummySubmitButton.on('click', event =>
  APPCORE_DATASUBMIT.HandleFormSubmit(event, 'param')
);

/** An Extended Comment Block *************************************************\

\*****************************************************************************/

/*/ This style of comment is used for blocks of text that are are commentary
    or placeholders to "think out loud". Visually they are less heavy-weight than
    the extended comment block format.

/*/
    Alternatively you can stack them like this.
    The general goal is to maintain a multiple of two space indents,
    while also maintaining a STRAIGHT LEFT EDGE to assist in scanning.
    This style is nice because of the symmetry and enforced spacing
    that separates the comment from its surroundings.
