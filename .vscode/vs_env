# vs_env - Sri's Visual Studio Code Environment Script
# 
# The following script is source'd from inside a Visual Studio Code integrated terminal
# and is located in a workspace .vscode folder. Accompanying changes must be made to
# the .code-workspace file to enable this script to run. As an example, these settings
# in the .code-workspace file will first force x86 mode on an ARM-based Mac through
# Rosetta 2, and then run the script vs_env script
