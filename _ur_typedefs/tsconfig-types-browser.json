/*///////////////////////////////// ABOUT \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*\

  This tsconfig file is used only by tsc to generate client type definitions

  This is the minimal configuration needed to generate type definitions, and
  is simpler than the node-server configuration because it doesn't handle
  mixed code, is bundled, and doesn't have NodeJS's module resolution
  idiocyncracies.
